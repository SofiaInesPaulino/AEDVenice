Safety
•Make sure that you, the victim and others present are safe
Check if the victim replies
•Gently shake the victim by the shoulders and ask out loud, “How do you feel?”
Open the airways
•If the victim is unresponsive, place him/her in a supine position (face up)
•Place one hand on his/her forehead and the fingertips of the other hand under his/her chin, gently tilt his/her head back and lift his/her chin up
Breathing
•Look, listen, feel for no more than 10 seconds
•If the victim is breathing with difficulty, or is taking sporadic, very slow or noisy breaths, is NOT breathing normally
Alert emergency services
•If breathing is absent or abnormal, ask someone to call 112/118, or call it yourself
•Activate speakerphone to free your hands and start CPR, while talking to the operator
Get an AED
•Ask those close to you to bring an AED
•If you are alone, DO NOT move away from the victim but start CPR
Start chest compressions
•Kneel at the victim's side
•Place the heel of one hand in the center of the victim's chest
•Overlap the other hand on the first, crossing the fingers
•Keep your arms straight
•Position yourself over the victim's chest and compress by lowering the sternum by at least 5cm
•After each compression, allow the chest to return to the starting position but without losing contact between your hands and the victim's sternum
•Repeat compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute
Alternate compressions and rescue ventilations
•If you have learned to do so, after 30 compressions open the airway again by extending the head and lifting the chin
•Close the victim's nostrils by squeezing them with the index finger and thumb of the hand on the forehead
•Allow the victim's mouth to open slightly but keep the chin raised
•Take a normal breath and surround the victim's mouth with your lips, keeping them tightly closed.
•Blow quickly for 1 second into the victim's mouth watching if his chest rises: if it does, the ventilation is effective
•Keeping the head extended and chin raised, take your mouth off the victim and take a breath watching to see if the victim's chest drops again as the air comes out.
•Take a normal breath and blow into the victim's mouth again to perform the second rescue breath.
•Do not interrupt compressions for more than 10 seconds to perform two ventilations even if one or both are not effective
•Immediately place your hands back on the sternum in the correct position and perform another 30 compressions
•Continue alternating 30 compressions with 2 ventilations
•If you have not learned to do ventilations or cannot do them, continue with compressions only without interruptions (compress without interruptions at a rate of 100-120 per minute)
When AED arrives
•Turn on the AED and apply its paddles to the victim's bare chest
•If there are at least two of you helping the victim, one of you should continue the compressions while the other turns on the AED and attaches the chest pads
Follow the instructions
•Follow the voice and visual instructions provided by the AED
•If it recommends a shock, make sure that both you and the person receiving the shock are safe and no one else is touching the victim
•Press the shock button when the AED prompts you to do so
•Immediately resume compressions and continue following AED instructions
If the shock is not advised continue CPR
•If a shock is not advised, resume CPR immediately and continue following the AED instructions.
If the AED is not available continue CPR
•Unless you are certain the victim has recovered, continue CPR
•Signs that the victim has recovered can be: Awakening, Movements, Eye opening, Normal breathing
If the victim does not respond but breathe normally
•Put it in the lateral safety position
•Be ready to resume CPR immediately if the victim becomes unresponsive and stops breathing normally
